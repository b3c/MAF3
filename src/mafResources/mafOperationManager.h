/**
Class name: mafOperationManager
The mafOperationManager manage the creation and execution of operations. Operation are started in a separate thread
and according to the user's specification at GUI level, the operation can execute in background (asynchronous execution)
or no (synchronous execution). In the latter case the operation is always executed in a separate thread but the operation
manager waits that the thread is finished.
The manager defines these Topics:
- maf.local.resources.operation.start create the instance and initialize the operation.
- maf.local.resources.operation.started notify all the observer that the operation has started.
- maf.local.resources.operation.setParameters asign the parameters to the current started operation.
- maf.local.resources.operation.execute start the execution of operation.
- maf.local.resources.operation.executed notify that the operation terminated its execution and return an output as VariantHash.
- maf.local.resources.operation.executeWithParameters start the execution of operation.
- maf.local.resources.operation.stop terminate the execution of the operation.
- maf.local.resources.operation.undo allow to navigate in undo stack in order to restore data before current operation.
- maf.local.resources.operation.redo allow to navigate in undo stack in order apply the next operation.
- maf.local.resources.operation.clearundoStack clear the undo stack.
- maf.local.resources.operation.sizeUndoStack retrieve number of elements of undo stack.
- maf.local.resources.operation.currentRunning retrieve current operation.
- maf.local.resources.operation.executionPool Return the execution pool containing the running operations.
- maf.local.resources.operation.canSelectVME Return a boolean checking if the passed vme can be selected.
